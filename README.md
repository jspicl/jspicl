# jspicl
jspicl is a Javascript to PICO-8 Lua transpiler. It depends on Esprima to generate an AST which is then used to convert the original code into the LUA subset of which PICO-8 supports.

## Installation
```
npm install jspicl --save
```

## Usage
```js
import jspicl from "jspicl";

const javascriptCode = `...`;
const { output, polyfills } = jspicl(javascriptCode);
console.log(
  polyfills,
  output
);
```
